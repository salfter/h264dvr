This is an attempt at rolling my own DVR software for Bluecherry capture
cards.  So far, I have full-resolution, full-framerate capture working on 4
inputs of a 16-input card.  (I haven't tried more inputs or lower
resolution, as my intended application needed at least 640x480 at 30000/1001
fps.)  My intended design was to provide a server component that would run
under Linux to pass along requested video to a client that would work under
either Linux or Windows (built around wxWidgets).  These components are
missing.
